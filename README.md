# Application of Neural Topic Models for Exploration of Themes in Online Communities

Analysis of manosphere forums using Deep Neural Network based Topic Models

*I will be reorganizing the folder structure, refactoring the code and adding comments so that the project is easier to understand once I have the time !*

**Note: as our project deals with online masculine communities, some of the posts mentioned in this project contain disturbing material.**

## Abstract 

In recent years, online male support groups, which are part of the so-called manosphere, have been put in the spotlight because of their rise in misogynistic language, calls to violence, and growing popularity. However, the unstructured nature of online communities means that it is challenging to interpret. Neural Topic Models have received little attention and provide a poten- tial solution over classical methods like LDA. An obstacle in the way of expansion of adoption of Topic Modelling in Social Sciences is evaluation of the model outputs, for which human review re- mains a top choice. The development of rigorous methodology for human evaluation, however, has received little attention. In our project we explore the use of neural topic models and compare their performance to LDA using topic coherence and topic diversity as quantitative metrics. Further- more, we then treat the themes found by social scientists as gold standard in our evaluation, and present two methods to evaluate results of our topic model: topic and gender keyword associa- tion tests and document topic comparison.
